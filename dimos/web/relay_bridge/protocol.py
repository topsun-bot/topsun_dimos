"""Wire-protocol mirror of web/shared/protocol.ts.

Pinned by the golden vectors in web/shared/fixtures/ (tested from both pytest
and deno test). Validation runs on pydantic; nothing here needs aioquic or the
rest of the [web] extra.

Framing (see web/README.md for the upstream-bug rationale):
- Control stream frame: u32-LE length | UTF-8 JSON.
- Datagram: raw UTF-8 JSON, no length prefix.
- Data frame: u32-LE headerLen | u32-LE payloadLen | header JSON | payload.
  Latest channels send one frame per stream; a reliable channel packs its
  frames back to back on one persistent stream. Receivers count bytes and
  must never treat stream EOF as a message boundary (Deno 2.6.x delays FIN
  by up to ~1 s, and a persistent stream has no EOF between frames).
  Channel ids beginning with "@" are reserved for protocol control: the
  robot's hello rides an @control frame (datagram-encoded payload) on a
  one-shot bidi stream, and @-frames are never forwarded to viewers.

Validation policy (mirrored in protocol.ts): decoders validate shape strictly,
and receivers drop invalid or unknown messages -- a peer's bytes must never
kill a session. Framing-level corruption (absurd length prefixes) raises
ProtocolError and kills only the affected stream.
