"""E2e regression test for issue #3395: `dimos run --daemon` with zenoh.

Everything runs in subprocesses: the daemon must survive a real double fork
(zenoh's tokio runtime does not survive fork, so the daemon process must not
inherit any zenoh state), and the client must be a genuinely separate process.
This also keeps zenoh threads out of the pytest process.

Assumption: the zenoh `Coordinator/*` RPC keys are host-global over loopback
multicast (not namespaced per run). Since zenoh became the default, several
other tests serve a Coordinator too; what keeps them from answering this one's
probe is the per-worker scouting group conftest pins (`ZENOH_SCOUT_ADDR`),
with `--dist=loadfile` keeping this file on a single xdist worker.
