"""Record FAST-LIO odometry + lidar into a memory2 SQLite db.

A ``Recorder`` that records its In ports under their own names
(``fastlio_odometry`` / ``fastlio_lidar``) — wire them to FastLio2's
``odometry`` / ``lidar`` outputs with ``.remappings()``. Poses come straight
from the odometry stream (``@pose_setter_for``): each lidar frame is stamped with
the latest odometry pose so ``fastlio_lidar`` carries the trajectory and ``dimos
map global`` can register it.
