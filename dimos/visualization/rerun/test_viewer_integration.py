"""Tests for dimos-viewer integration with RerunBridgeModule.

These tests verify that:
1. The dimos-viewer binary is installed and discoverable
2. rerun_bindings.spawn() accepts the executable_name parameter
3. bridge.py has the correct spawn logic

These run in CI where dimos-viewer is a core dependency, so the binary
is always available. The main risk we're guarding against is rerun-sdk
pushing an update that breaks the spawn interface.
