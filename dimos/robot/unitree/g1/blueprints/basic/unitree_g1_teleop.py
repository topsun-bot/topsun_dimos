"""Unitree G1 GR00T WBC + Quest teleop + manipulation + recording.

The GR00T locomotion/control core (without navigation, mapping, or the legacy
viewer) plus the Quest WebXR retargeting module, collision-aware arm
manipulation, and the dimos.imitation data-collection stack. ``--simulation
mujoco`` and ``--scene-package`` remain supported. Put on the headset, open
``https://<host>:8443/teleop``, and:

    X + A             hold to track both arms from a shared reference
    B                 start / save an episode
    Y                 discard the in-progress episode

Controller poses route to the shared ``teleop_g1`` coordinator task declared
in the groot blueprint. Quest thumbstick locomotion is intentionally deferred;
this module does not route controller axes to the GR00T WBC task.

Recording runs continuously into a timestamped session DB under
``~/.local/state/dimos/recordings/``; B/Y only place episode markers
(EpisodeMonitorModule). Off-sim, a RealSense provides ``color_image`` —
recorded for training and pushed into the headset as the operator's view.
The groot MuJoCo sim publishes no color camera, so sim sessions record
joints/commands only (point DataPrep's sync anchor at joint state, or
enable a sim color camera, if you need images from sim).

Export afterwards with ``dimos dataprep build`` — measured joint state,
the commanded wrist poses, and episode status are all in the DB, so
action semantics (next-state vs commanded) are a DataPrep config choice.

Usage:
    dimos --simulation mujoco --scene-package office run unitree-g1-teleop
    dimos run unitree-g1-teleop                      # real hardware
