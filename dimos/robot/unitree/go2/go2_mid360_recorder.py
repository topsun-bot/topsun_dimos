"""Records the Go2 + Mid-360 rig into a memory2 SQLite db.

Captures Point-LIO odom + lidar (trajectory baked into ``pointlio_lidar`` via the
inherited ``@pose_setter_for``) plus the Go2's companion streams. The raw Livox
stream is NOT recorded here — enable the pcap recorder in the record blueprint to
capture it. Companion streams are recorded as-is and anchored via the static mount
frames published on tf.
