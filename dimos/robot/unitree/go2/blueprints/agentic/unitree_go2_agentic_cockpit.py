"""The agentic go2 with an authored cockpit: video left, costmap+pose over
keyboard teleop in the middle, the agent chat right (the humancli
conversation on McpClient's human_input/agent/agent_idle streams, with the
composer's push-to-talk mic feeding CockpitVoiceInput -> the shared Whisper
pipeline), plus a full-page camera view on its own tab. The cockpit
replaces the legacy :5555 WebInput page, so that module is disabled here
rather than started alongside.

Separate file on purpose: cockpit() needs the [web] extra at import time,
and `unitree-go2-agentic` itself must stay importable without it.
