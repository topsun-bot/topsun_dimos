"""The smart go2 with an authored cockpit: video left (2/3), costmap+pose
over keyboard teleop right. Edit the layout (swap Row for Col, change
shares, drop a panel) and rerun - the browser rearranges and dropped
channels leave the wire entirely.

Separate file on purpose: cockpit() needs the [web] extra at import time,
and `unitree-go2` itself must stay importable without it.
