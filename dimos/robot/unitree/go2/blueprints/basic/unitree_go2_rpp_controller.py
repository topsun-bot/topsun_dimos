"""Unitree Go2 RPP controller — a standalone, path-following control process.

GO2Connection + a ControlCoordinator running the calibrated regulated-pure-
pursuit (RPP) follower, plus a KeyboardTeleop for manual positioning. There is
NO planner and NO map here: this blueprint is a controller you feed paths to
from any source over the transport.

Interface (pure LCM pub/sub — the ONLY coupling to whatever drives it):

    IN   path   (nav_msgs/Path)        -> coordinator.path  -> rpp_follower.on_path
    IN   speed  (std_msgs/Float32, m/s)-> coordinator.speed -> rpp_follower.on_speed
    OUT  odom   (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped, /go2/odom)  -- the Go2 leg odom
    OUT  cmd_vel(geometry_msgs/Twist,        /cmd_vel)  -- aggregated command echo

Two tasks ship: ``vel_go2`` (priority 20, idle/teleop) and ``rpp_follower``
(priority 10). The follower is the only task the coordinator's ``set_path``
broadcast arms, so a published path drives pursuit and nothing else. Holding a
WASD key publishes a Twist on ``/cmd_vel`` (the coordinator's ``twist_command``
input), driving the priority-20 ``vel_go2`` task and preempting the follower —
that is how the operator repositions/aims the robot between runs. Preemption
aborts the active path, so publish a new path to resume autonomous following.

KeyboardTeleop also emits a per-run **gate** (``ENTER``/``K``/``Backspace`` ->
advance/skip/quit) on ``/benchmark/gate``, which the benchmark process consumes
to pace its runs. The follower self-calibrates from a vendored tuning artifact
on the first path (feedforward so commanded == achieved, curvature speed
regulation, measured yaw-rate clamp) and runs forward-only (the Go2 lidar faces
forward; no strafe/reverse off the path).

Run the controller standalone to drive paths from any source on ``/path``::

    dimos run unitree-go2-rpp-controller

To pace runs with the built-in battery instead, run ``unitree-go2-rpp-benchmark``,
which composes this controller with the Benchmarker in one process.
