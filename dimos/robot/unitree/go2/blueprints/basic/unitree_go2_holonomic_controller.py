"""Unitree Go2 holonomic full-pose controller — a standalone control process.

The strafe-capable counterpart to ``unitree-go2-rpp-controller``: the same
GO2Connection + ControlCoordinator + KeyboardTeleop shell, but the follower is
the progress-indexed HOLONOMIC full-pose tracker. It consumes a poses-only Path
whose per-waypoint orientation is the planner's COMMANDED heading — possibly
decoupled from the travel direction (face along a tunnel while strafing
through it) — and tracks position and yaw simultaneously. RPP cannot do this
(it faces the travel direction); conversely, for position-only paths where
tangent heading is wanted, use the RPP controller instead. Never run both
followers in one coordinator — they would fight over the base joints.

Interface (pure LCM pub/sub, identical to the RPP controller):

    IN   path   (nav_msgs/Path)        -> coordinator.path  -> holonomic_follower.on_path
    IN   speed  (std_msgs/Float32, m/s)-> coordinator.speed -> holonomic_follower.on_speed
    OUT  odom   (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped, /go2/odom)  -- the Go2 leg odom
    OUT  cmd_vel(geometry_msgs/Twist,        /cmd_vel)  -- aggregated command echo

The priority-20 ``vel_go2`` teleop task preempts the priority-10 follower while
a WASD key is held (repositioning between runs); KeyboardTeleop also emits the
per-run gate on ``/benchmark/gate``. The follower self-calibrates from the
vendored pose-domain artifact on the first path (per-axis P gains from the
plant fit, feedforward gain inversion, measured envelope caps).

Run the controller standalone to drive paths from any source on ``/path``::

    dimos run unitree-go2-holonomic-controller

To pace runs with the built-in battery instead, run
``unitree-go2-holonomic-benchmark``, which composes this controller with the
Benchmarker in one process.
