"""Unitree Go2 RPP benchmark — controller + benchmark in ONE launchable.

A dimos blueprint is a composition of Modules that each run as their own worker
and communicate over the transport. So "two independently-launchable entities
that talk only over LCM" is realized as ONE ``dimos run`` that deploys both
module-sets — the controller (``unitree-go2-rpp-controller``: GO2Connection +
ControlCoordinator + KeyboardTeleop) and the ``Benchmarker``. They are still
fully decoupled: the Benchmarker imports nothing from the controller and only
talks to it over LCM topics —

    Benchmarker.path  -> /path           -> coordinator arms the follower
    Benchmarker.speed -> /speed          -> coordinator retunes the follower
    Benchmarker.odom  <- /go2/odom       -- the executed pose
    Benchmarker.cmd_vel <- /cmd_vel      -- the command sent to the robot
    Benchmarker.operator_command <- /benchmark/gate -- operator advance/skip/quit (teleop)

(Two separate ``dimos run`` processes can't share an LCM bus — the runtime's
``Coordinator`` RPC service is a per-bus singleton — so one blueprint is the
correct dimos shape. The Benchmarker stays controller-agnostic: point it at a
different controller just by composing a different one here.)

Run (one terminal). Focus the pygame window: WASD to position the robot, then
ENTER to start each run (K=skip, Backspace=quit). Completion is detected from
odom automatically::

    dimos run unitree-go2-rpp-benchmark
    # afterwards, score offline (the benchmark logs the recordings dir on start):
    python -m dimos.control.benchmarking.score <recordings-dir>

To drive paths from some OTHER source instead of the benchmark, launch the
controller alone: ``dimos run unitree-go2-rpp-controller``.
