"""Every Go2 blueprint publishes a tf tree, not a tf graph.

tf gives each frame one parent. Two publishers writing the same child frame make
the buffer a graph instead, and a lookup then resolves by hop count rather than by
which source is authoritative, so the wrong odometry can win silently. Each
blueprint keeps the invariant a different way: nav_3d turns GO2Connection's tf off
so the static mount tree owns base_link, and the static tree is rooted at
mid360_link so it never writes the frame PointLio owns.
