"""go2/ControlEvent — app-level JSON control-log events (topic ``control_log``).

A tagged event stream keyed by ``type`` (e.g. ``velocity_input`` carries
``lx/ly/az``; ``brightness`` carries ``level``). Fields beyond ``type`` are
optional; :class:`~dimos.robot.unitree.go2.dds.codec.JsonCodec` drops keys it
doesn't recognise, so new event shapes won't break decoding.
