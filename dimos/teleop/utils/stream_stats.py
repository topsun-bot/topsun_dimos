"""Stat helpers for teleop streams (latency / jitter / rate).

Two flavors live here:

* **`pcts`** — a pure percentile helper shared by the post-hoc report writer
  (``teleop/utils/report.py``) and any live stats consumer.
* **`LiveStreamStats`** — a rolling-window class for always-on consumers that
  only need a recent snapshot (e.g. the operator HUD's command-plane telemetry).

Packet loss / reorder are transport-layer concerns and are intentionally not
computed here from an application sequence number. TODO: surface command-plane
loss from datachannel/SCTP stats (same source as VideoStats.loss_pct), not a
per-message seq.
