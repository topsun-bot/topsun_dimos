"""Live passive smoke: real model, real LFS recordings. Self-hosted + API key.

Runs only the ``numeric`` cases (odom + pointcloud str encodings) — the
self-hosted ros-dev container has no libturbojpeg, so image-encoding cases
are exercised locally via ``dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples``.
