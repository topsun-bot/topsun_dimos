"""3D-printable AprilTag/ArUco generator for multicolor (AMS/MMU) printers.

Emits two solids per tag that share one coordinate frame and meet flush at the top
face: `base` (light) is the plate minus the dark cells, `marker` (dark) is only the
top `marker_mm` of the tag's black cells. Printed together the top surface is flat —
no relief, so no shadows at grazing light angles.

Sizes match the PDF generator: the tag's outer black border edge measures `size_mm`,
which is the value to pass as `tag_size` to pose estimation.
