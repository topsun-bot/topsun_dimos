"""CollectionRecorder — captures teleop collection streams to a memory DB.

A `Recorder` (memory) subscribes each declared `In` port and appends every
message to a SQLite store, flushing durably on stop(). Only *connected*
streams are recorded, so the same recorder works for any arm whose
coordinator publishes `coordinator_joint_state`.

The recorded stream names match what DataPrep reads: `color_image`
and `coordinator_joint_state` (observation), `status` (episode segmentation).
