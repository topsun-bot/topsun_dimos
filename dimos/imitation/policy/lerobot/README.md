# LeRobot Policy Module

`LeRobotPolicyModule` runs trained LeRobot policies in a managed Python-native
subprocess. Its LeRobot, Transformers, Torch, and NumPy versions live in the
`native/python/lerobot` project and do not change the main DimOS environment.

The host contract subscribes to:

- `color_image: Image`
- `coordinator_joint_state: JointState`
- `button_pressed: Buttons`
- `teleop_buttons: Buttons`

It submits complete, timestamped action chunks to the existing
`joint_trajectory` task through the control coordinator. The state and action
vectors use `joint_names` order, including any gripper joint. The policy output
is already postprocessed into each joint's native absolute coordinate; the
runtime does not reinterpret gripper values.

```python
from dimos.imitation.policy.lerobot.module import LeRobotPolicyModule

policy = LeRobotPolicyModule.blueprint(
    policy_path="outputs/pick/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model",
    task="pick up the object",
    joint_names=["arm/joint1", "arm/joint2", "arm/gripper"],
    fps=30.0,
    robot_type="my_robot",
    image_width=640,
    image_height=480,
)
```

The module exposes `preflight_rollout`, `start_rollout`, `stop_rollout`, and
`rollout_status` RPCs. Preflight loads the checkpoint and processors, validates
the control task and fresh live observations, and sends no trajectory.
`start_rollout` refuses to run until preflight passes and rechecks observations
before starting.
The runtime rejects missing or stale observations, missing joints, non-finite
values, incompatible checkpoint features, and malformed action chunks. Pressing the
configured Quest button (A by default) toggles a preflighted rollout. Pressing
either middle-finger grip stops rollout. Release both grips before explicitly
restarting; releasing a grip alone never resumes the policy.

The runtime calls LeRobot's `predict_action_chunk()`, postprocesses the entire
chunk, clips every action dimension to the checkpoint's recorded data range,
and executes its first `n_action_steps` at the configured `fps`. Trajectory execution uses the coordinator's existing start-position and velocity handling. Configure `fps` to
match the action frequency used by the training dataset.

Current limitation: this contract assumes every postprocessed action is an
absolute target in the connected hardware joint's native coordinate. A generic
contract for checkpoints that encode grippers in normalized or device-specific
coordinates remains future work; this runtime does not special-case those
grippers.

Run isolated runtime checks with:

```bash
cd native/python/lerobot
uv run --isolated --locked --group tests --with-editable ../../.. python -m pytest
uv run --isolated --locked --group tests --with-editable ../../.. python -m mypy
```
