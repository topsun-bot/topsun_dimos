"""Custom-channel browser e2e (the W6 acceptance demo, in CI).

Starts a cockpit(channels=[...]) bridge - a generated RelayBridgeModule
subclass with a nav_path In[Path] port whose path.points.v1 encoder was
resolved from the codec registry at blueprint definition time - serving
web/examples/custom-path from its own local relay. The page registers the
matching JavaScript decoder, subscribes manually (no cockpit panel anywhere in
the chain), and must render the decoded points: Python @web_encoder -> relay
-> browser decoder, end to end.

The bridge runs in-process (like the relay_bridge e2e) on an ephemeral port,
so it cannot clash with test_sdk_browser's stack on :7780 in the same CI job.

Marked web_browser: excluded from the default suite (needs the
`browser-tests` dependency group, Playwright browsers, and built web dists).
Locally:
`uv run --group browser-tests pytest -m web_browser dimos/e2e_tests/test_custom_channel_browser.py`.
