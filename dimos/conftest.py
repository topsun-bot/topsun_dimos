# Pin every pytest session to its own LCM bus and its own zenoh scouting group
# *before* any dimos module is imported (``LCMConfig`` captures
# ``LCM_DEFAULT_URL`` at import time), so
# messages from processes outside the session (a dev ``dimos`` daemon, a
# leaked DimSim bridge, a concurrent pytest run) can't leak into
# subscribe_all/pattern tests. It has to be an env var (not just a fixture)
# because subprocesses spawned by tests (``ModuleCoordinator`` workers, the
# DimSim Deno bridge) create their own LCM instances and inherit our env.
#
# Zenoh needs the same treatment for the same reason: its default discovery is
# loopback multicast, which every worker and every concurrent session on this
# machine shares. ``ZENOH_SCOUT_ADDR`` moves each onto its own group.
#
# Buckets are seeded with the session run id so concurrent sessions on one
# machine can't collide. xdist workers mix in the worker name, and also get
# a per-worker MCP port (``GlobalConfig`` captures ``MCP_PORT``) and state
# dir (``run_registry`` captures ``XDG_STATE_HOME``), which only collide
# between parallel workers. Exporting ``LCM_DEFAULT_URL`` yourself opts a
# single-worker session out of the isolation, deliberately joining it to an
# external bus; ``ZENOH_SCOUT_ADDR`` does the same for zenoh.
