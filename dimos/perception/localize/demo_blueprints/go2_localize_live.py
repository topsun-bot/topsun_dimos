"""A go2 recording looped as a live feed, with localize behind an agent skill.

This is the deployment shape of the perception memory stack: one module owns
a store and the models, ``DanDetector.embed_live`` keeps a background
tail filling the index while the robot runs, and a ``@skill`` answers
``localize`` calls against whatever has been embedded so far.

:class:`LoopFeeder` stands in for the sensors and the recorder. It replays a
recording into a fresh store forever, adding the recording's own span to
every timestamp each lap, so the store's clock only moves forward while the
scene repeats. The message stamp, the observation stamp and every tf
transform shift by the same lap offset, so pose interpolation, cloud
accumulation and the index window all see one continuous take. It writes the
tf chain and the camera intrinsics too, the way a robot connection would.

The canonical recording is opened read-only and never written.
