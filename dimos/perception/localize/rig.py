"""The sensor rig behind a run: intrinsics, poses, and 3D geometry.

Three independent axes generalize the stack beyond one robot: pose from a
``tf`` stream or from stamped world poses plus a static mount; geometry from
an aligned ``depth`` stream or a world-frame pointcloud; and intrinsics and
mounts keyed by optical frame, each lookup taking the frame off the image it
resolves rather than off a single rig-wide field.

:meth:`Rig.from_store` recognizes a recording's shape and self-calibrates what
it omits; a robot that knows its calibration builds a ``Rig`` field by field
and never touches it.
