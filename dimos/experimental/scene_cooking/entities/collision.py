"""Cook-time convex decomposition for scene-package entities.

Mesh entities need convex collision geometry for MuJoCo's narrowphase.
The cooker decomposes each entity's ``visual.glb`` with CoACD (chair
legs / seat / back each get their own hull, so contacts are
chair-shaped) and writes the hulls into the package next to the visual:

```text
entities/<safe_id>/
├── visual.glb
└── mujoco_collision/
    ├── hull_000.obj
    └── ...
```

The hull paths are recorded per entity as ``collision_paths`` in
``scene.meta.json`` and loaded verbatim by the runtime composer
(``dimos/simulation/mujoco/scene_package_entity_composer.py``) — there is no runtime
decomposition and no per-machine cache; the package is self-contained.
