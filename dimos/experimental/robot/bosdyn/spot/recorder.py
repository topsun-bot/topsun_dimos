"""Record every Spot data stream into a memory SQLite db.

A ``Recorder`` whose In ports mirror `SpotHighLevel`'s outputs — the five
grayscale cameras, five depth cameras, and body odometry — so `autoconnect`
wires them by name. The base class writes each port (plus the live tf tree) to
``db_path``; poses come from tf, so recorded frames stay spatially anchored.
