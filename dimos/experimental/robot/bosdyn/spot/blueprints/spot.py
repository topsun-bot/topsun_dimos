"""Boston Dynamics Spot: click/teleop driving plus full sensor streaming + Rerun.

The Rerun web UI is the driver: `RerunWebSocketServer` turns clicks into
`clicked_point` and browser keys into `tele_cmd_vel`. `MovementManager` muxes
those (and any `nav_cmd_vel`) into a single `cmd_vel`, which `SpotHighLevel`
executes. The same module streams the five fisheye + five depth cameras and body
odometry. Because the browser is the input surface there is no on-main-thread
pygame window, so this runs on macOS.

The ip auto-detects: with no `--spothighlevel.ip=` given, it probes Spot's WiFi
AP address (192.168.80.3) then the Ethernet address (10.0.0.3) and uses
whichever answers.

Usage:
    dimos run spot \
        --spothighlevel.username=admin --spothighlevel.password=<password>
    # or force an address:
    dimos run spot ... --spothighlevel.ip=10.0.0.3
