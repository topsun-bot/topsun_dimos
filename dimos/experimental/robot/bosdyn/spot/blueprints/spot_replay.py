"""Replay the latest Spot recording to Rerun — no robot, runs anywhere.

`SpotReplay` plays a memory recording (from `spot-record`) back onto the same
stream names `SpotHighLevel` uses, so the Spot camera layout and per-camera
frustums light up in the Rerun 3D view. The `visual_override` routes the two
shared CameraInfo streams onto each camera's image entity so every frustum
anchors to its optical frame.

Usage:
    # the shared recording, pulled from LFS on first run:
    dimos run spot-replay --db-path=spot_small_loop.db
    # newest *.db under dimos' recordings dir (RECORDINGS_DIR/spot):
    dimos run spot-replay
    # a specific recording:
    dimos run spot-replay --db-path=/path/to/spot.db
