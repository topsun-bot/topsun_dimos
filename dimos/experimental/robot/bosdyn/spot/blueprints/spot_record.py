"""Spot: drive it from the Rerun web UI while recording every data stream.

The default `spot` blueprint (click/teleop driving + full sensor streaming +
Rerun) with `SpotRecorder` added, so every one of `SpotHighLevel`'s streams
(the five fisheye + five depth cameras and odometry, plus the live tf tree) is
written to a memory SQLite db as you drive. `autoconnect` wires the recorder's
In ports to `SpotHighLevel`'s outputs by name.

Usage:
    dimos run spot-record \
        --spothighlevel.username=admin --spothighlevel.password=<password>
    # choose where the recording lands:
    dimos run spot-record ... --spotrecorder.db_path=/path/to/spot.db
