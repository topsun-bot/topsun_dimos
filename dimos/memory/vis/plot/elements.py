    ``connect`` is the maximum gap (in x-axis units, typically seconds) over
    which the renderer will draw a connecting line. Samples whose neighbors
    are further apart get visually separated — useful when a stream has
    holes (e.g. an embedding stream that skipped dark frames). Set to
    ``None`` to always connect regardless of gap size.

    ``gap_fill`` controls what happens at a gap. ``None`` (default) breaks
    the line entirely. A float value drops the line to that value across
    the gap, producing a "valley" — set ``gap_fill=0.0`` to render holes as
    drops to zero.
