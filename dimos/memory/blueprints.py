"""``dimos --replay-db <memory.db> run replay``: every recorded stream back on the bus, with the viewer.

``--replay-db`` is a recording path or a bare dataset name (data/, LFS), like ``--replay``.
The ports are read from it when this module is imported by ``dimos run replay``. Elsewhere
(the blueprint registry, workers, tests) ``Replay`` has no class-level ports; instances add
them from ``dataset``.
