"""Relocalization: place the live ``world`` frame inside a prior map's ``map`` frame.

This file is the contract: every relocalizer, whatever it matches, loads a
prior map and answers with a ``world -> map`` transform, so it publishes the
same two things - that transform on ``tf`` and the placed prior map on
``loaded_map``. All of that lives here: ``map_file`` is read into
``self.premap``, republished on ``loaded_map`` once a fix can resolve its
frame, and :meth:`RelocalizationModule.submit` takes the transform.

An implementation reads ``self.premap`` in its own ``start()`` (after
``super().start()``, and ``None`` means no map was configured), builds
whatever it matches against, and drives itself from its own inputs. It owns
what the base cannot know: which ports it listens on, when to attempt a fix,
and how good a fix must be. Matching lidar against the premap's points,
apriltags against tag poses baked into it and GPS against a datum share none
of that. See ``lidar/module.py``, the pointcloud runtime.

Whether a fix is good enough is the implementation's call, made against its
own config. A second threshold here would be a second place to configure one
decision, and the two would drift.

A dual strategy is a subclass of two implementations: ports merge across the
MRO and ``start()`` chains through ``super()``.
