"""Placing a live lidar cloud into a prior map.

Coarse FPFH+RANSAC to find the place, then point-to-plane ICP over
widening-to-narrowing distances to settle it. No streams, no modules, no
clock - :mod:`dimos.mapping.relocalization.module` is the runtime around
this, and ``tune.py`` measures it. Strategies + evals began at
https://github.com/leshy/relocalization-test (this was ``align_fast``).

    relocalizer = LidarRelocalizer(premap_cloud, PRESETS["mid360"])
    tf = relocalizer.relocalize(live_cloud)   # world -> map, or None if it refused

The map is preprocessed once when the relocalizer is built - downsampling
it, estimating normals and computing FPFH features is the pipeline's
dominant cost, and it does not change between queries.

Every scale in a :class:`RelocalizeConfig` was measured against one rig on
one recording, so configs are named rather than universal - there is no
default config, only :data:`PRESETS`. See tune.md for how to measure one
for a rig that is not in there yet.
