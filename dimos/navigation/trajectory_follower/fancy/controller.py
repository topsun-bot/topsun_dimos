"""The controller seam: pose + Path in, body-frame Twist out.

The protocol is the deployment seam: on the robot the same object consumes
the pose off the odometry message and the planner topic; here the episode
runner feeds it the simulated equivalents. There is no tf lookup on either
side. The laws themselves live in
:mod:`dimos.navigation.trajectory_follower.fancy.laws`, one module each; the follower
runs ``hinted`` unless its config names another ``"module:factory"``.
