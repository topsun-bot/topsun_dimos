"""Rendering for :class:`MLSPlannerNative`'s introspection layers.

The planner can publish what it actually searched over: the traversable surface it
extracted, the graph nodes it sampled on that surface, and the weighted edges between
them. Its ``viz_publish_hz`` config decides whether it emits them (0.0 = not at all,
which is the default — the geometry is rebuilt from scratch every tick).
:func:`planner_visual_override` reads that same number so a blueprint only has to set it
in one place; drawing and publishing cannot drift apart.
