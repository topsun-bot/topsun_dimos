"""Which returns are obstacles: a property of the body, not of the scene.

The planner's world is a z-slice of the cloud, and where that slice belongs is
something the robot already knows: the base rides `base_height` above the
surface its feet stand on. Re-reference the cloud to that surface and the
geometry reads itself: below `steppable` the legs negotiate it, above
`height` the body passes underneath, in between it is a wall. Nothing is
estimated off the scene, so nothing can be estimated wrong.

A model is z-only and says nothing about xy. The frame is the caller's: the
adapter re-references the cloud (`adapter/planner.py`) before handing it over,
and `hard_points` is where the two meet.
