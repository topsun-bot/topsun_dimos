"""Precision encoded in the path's own timestamps: the wire dialect.

Per-waypoint ``ts`` deltas = segment length / governor speed at that segment's
clearance. Not a schedule: a follower never chases the clock, only the deltas
carry information, and running slower than the encoding is always legal.

Encoding is planner/annotator-owned: when the executor's measured precision
improves, only :func:`governor_speed` moves and every follower keeps
decoding dt/length naively. Fan segments (rotation in place, ~zero length)
carry dt = yaw span / max yaw rate so the timeline stays monotone.
