"""Pluggable planner interface for the motion environment.

A candidate is a factory `make(emb, resolution) -> PlannerEpisode`. The episode
is stateful across plan() calls (warm starts, hysteresis live inside it) and
nothing survives reset(). Honest candidates read only what plan() receives
(obstacles, pose, goal); the factory sees the embodiment and the waypoint
spacing, never a world.

`plan` also takes the route the caller has PUBLISHED, or None on the first call
and after a reset. The shell owns that memory (`adapter/planner.py` and the
episode loop already hold the last plan); the planner owns the judgment of
whether a fresh answer has earned the switch.

The search is PLANAR. `plan` is handed obstacle positions as (N, 2) xy, with
no z to read and therefore none to re-interpret: which returns are obstacles
was decided before the call, by an obstacle model that knows the body
(`motion/obstacles.py`). A candidate that wanted a z rule of its own would be
a second source of truth for the same question, which is the bug this shape
exists to make unrepresentable.
