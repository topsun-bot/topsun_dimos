"""Provider contract for WebRTC DataChannel backends.

``Provider`` is the runtime interface; ``ProviderConfig`` is its picklable,
hashable description. Transports carry configs across process boundaries
(module workers receive their transports by pickle) and resolve them to a
per-process singleton provider — one PeerConnection per process, shared by
every transport with an equal config.
