# Cloud data

`dimos data` uploads recordings, or any file, to Dimensional's hosted storage and pulls them back byte-identical on any machine. Authenticate once with `dimos login` (device code; the key lands in the system keyring, or `~/.config/dimos/credentials`).

```bash
dimos login
dimos data upload                                  # newest recording under recordings/
dimos data upload latest                           # same, spelled out
dimos data upload recordings/<run-id>/memory.db    # a specific file
dimos data upload --since 1h                       # every recording from the last hour
dimos data ls
dimos data pull                                    # newest upload -> downloads/
dimos data pull 9a6bf9ab                           # id prefix from ls
dimos data pull latest --dest my.db
dimos data quota
```

## Uploads

Any file type is accepted. Kind is inferred: a mem2 SQLite store (has a `_streams` table) or `.mcap` is a `recording`, anything else a `blob`. Override it with `--kind`. `--robot` tags a robot id, `--chunk` sets the multipart part size in MB.

- Files are compressed before transfer (lz4 by default, see below), sha256-verified server-side, and deduplicated by content: re-uploading the same bytes reports `already uploaded`.
- Interrupted uploads resume: the server's part listing is the only resume state, so a killed upload re-sends only the missing parts.
- Recordings carry a manifest: the stream list from `_streams` plus the blueprint name parsed from the `<stamp>-<blueprint>` run directory. `dimos data ls` shows both.
- Discovery modes (no argument, `--since`) skip files modified within the last `dimos_upload_quiet_s` seconds (default 30) so a store that is still being written is not shipped mid-run. Naming a path or `latest` is explicit intent and uploads immediately.
- Compression stages next to the source file (not `/tmp`), with a free-space check first; point `dimos_staging_dir` at a bigger partition if needed.

## Pulls

Pulls land in `downloads/` under the checkout (`~/.local/state/dimos/downloads/` for an installed package), named `<upload-time>-<id-prefix>-<filename>` so nothing overwrites. `--dest` takes an exact target path. The wire bytes are sha256-verified, decoded, and moved into place atomically; a failed pull never clobbers an existing destination file.

View a pulled recording with [`dimos mem rerun`](/docs/usage/cli.md):

```bash
dimos mem rerun downloads/<pulled-file>.db
```

## Compression

`dimos_upload_codec` selects the algorithm; the upload's `content_encoding` stamp selects the decoder on pull, so mixed-codec stores coexist.

| codec | ratio* | compress* | notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| `lz4` | 0.59 | 0.04s | default; near-free CPU |
| `gzip` | 0.49 | 1.6s | |
| `bz2` | 0.46 | 0.5s | |
| `xz` | 0.40 | 2.9s | densest, slowest |
| `""` | 1.00 | 0s | upload raw |

*measured on a 12.6 MB Go2 recording; ratios vary with content.

Like every `GlobalConfig` field, it is settable three ways (global flags go before the subcommand):

```bash
dimos --dimos-upload-codec xz data upload
DIMOS_UPLOAD_CODEC=gzip dimos data upload
echo 'DIMOS_UPLOAD_CODEC=gzip' >> .env
```

## Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `dimos_cloud_url` | `https://api.dimensional.org` | API host |
| `dimos_api_key` | `None` | Overrides the stored `dimos login` credential (`DIMOS_API_KEY` for CI) |
| `dimos_upload_codec` | `lz4` | `lz4`, `gzip`, `bz2`, `xz`, or `""` for no compression |
| `dimos_upload_chunk_mb` | `None` | Multipart part size in MB (`--chunk`); server default 64 |
| `dimos_upload_retries` | `2` | Per-part retries for transfers |
| `dimos_upload_quiet_s` | `30.0` | Discovery skips files modified this recently |
| `dimos_http_timeout` | `60.0` | Seconds per API request |
| `dimos_staging_dir` | `None` | Compression/decode staging dir; default is beside the file |

## Organizations

Accounts can belong to an organization. Members of an org see every dataset the org
owns: `dimos data ls` lists them with an extra `uploader` column, and `dimos data
pull` works on any of them. Uploads are stamped with your org automatically. Datasets
can be deleted by their uploader or by an org admin, and they stay with the org if
the uploader leaves. Admins manage members, roles and per-member storage limits at
[console.dimensional.org](https://console.dimensional.org).
