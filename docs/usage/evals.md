# Evals

## Terminology

- **Case**: a discrete scenario being tested. This specifies the prompt sent to the agent, the environment, and scoring functions for the final world state and agent response.
- **Environment**: this is either a dataset, a live simulation, or an image file being passed to the agent.
- **Suite**: a collection of cases.
- **Agent**: this is a wrapper that might contain an entire agent loop, a single request to an llm provider, and it may contain tools. Agents include our mcp client, pi, as well as a simple single-turn question/answer with no tools.

## Quick start (CLI)

```bash skip
# two documentation cases against the go2_short recording (needs OPENAI_API_KEY)
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.question_answer

# same cases with observations withheld (the guessing ablation)
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.blind

# same cases, the Pi coding agent over the recording as a file (needs pi on PATH)
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.pi

# list suites
dimos evals list
```

Every runner invocation writes one `~/.local/state/dimos/evals/run-*/` directory.

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | immutable, versioned run inputs: source, ordered selected case IDs, explicit agent arguments, runner settings, and Git state |
| `results.jsonl` | one row per case: score, steps, tokens, seconds, `ended_by`, trajectory path |
| `summary.json` | aggregate outcomes |
| `<case_id>/trajectory.json` | the run in Harbor's [ATIF](https://www.harborframework.com/docs/agents/trajectory-format) format
| `<case_id>/raw/NNN-request.json`, `NNN-response.json` | the exact payload sent to and received from the provider for every call |

## Baseline without dimOS versus dimcode + dimOS

For the product comparison, run `PiAdapter` with `no_dimos=true` against `DimcodeAdapter`
with the **same model**. The baseline keeps Pi's normal tools, the internet, pip, git and any
public SDK; the only thing withheld is dimOS.

```bash skip
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.pi \
  --set no_dimos=true --set model=gpt-6-astra --set thinking=medium \
  --set max_steps=250 --set max_output_tokens=4096

dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.dimcode \
  --set model=gpt-6-astra --set thinking=medium \
  --set max_steps=250 --set max_output_tokens=4096
```

The same switches compose with the tool allowlist and an explicit keyword list, so a
restricted or differently guarded baseline is one flag away:

```bash skip
# Bash and grep only, no dimOS
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.pi \
  --allow bash,grep --set no_dimos=true --set model=gpt-6-astra

# full Pi toolset, dimOS available, but any tool call naming a vendor SDK is denied
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.pi \
  --exclude unitree_sdk2py,go2_webrtc --set model=gpt-6-astra

# no tools at all: the model answers from the prompt
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.examples --agent dimos.evals.agents.pi \
  --allow "" --set model=gpt-6-astra
```

`no_dimos` is a field of the shared `AgentConfig`. Agents that are dimOS, dimcode and the MCP client, reject it; tool-less agents satisfy it as they are. For Pi it does four things. Pi runs with a `PATH` that has no dimOS executable or checkout
venv, no `PYTHONPATH` and no `DIMOS_*` variables, so `import dimos` and `dimos` fail. A robot
is exposed as live topics through `raw-robot-bridge` (below) and nothing else: no recording,
no MCP tool listing, no `dimos mcp call` guidance. `excluded_keywords` defaults to
`dimos, dimensionalos`, which denies any tool call that mentions them. And for `Dataset` cases,
which ask about an existing recording with no robot running, the selected observations are
exported as plain files, lossless PNGs, XYZ/RGB CSVs and JSON primitives with a manifest,
because the memory store needs dimOS to read.

`PiAdapter` uses Pi's stock loop, provider support, tracing, limits and cleanup; `no_dimos`
changes only what it is handed. For a `Dataset` case the baseline receives selected point
coordinates and colors as CSV, camera frames as lossless PNG and primitive observations as
JSON, with timestamps and hashes; no `agent_encode` summaries, labels, semantic tags or the
original database. For a robot case it receives the raw topics and `ROBOT.md`. Dimcode
receives the same selected observations through the dimOS store, the robot through MCP, and
keeps its production tools and skills. Representation and delivery differences between the
arms are part of the comparison and belong in the report.

The baseline runs on the host with the host's system packages; record their versions when
freezing a pilot, this is not a pinned container image. Neither arm may receive task-specific
solutions or hidden truth, and dimcode's production environment must not be able to reach
graders or reference data.

### Keyword guard

`excluded_keywords` is shared `AgentConfig`; set it with `--exclude dimos,dimensionalos` or
`--set excluded_keywords=[...]`. Before a tool runs, the shared Pi extension matches the call's
arguments, lowercased, against each keyword as a whole token: `import dimos`, `/opt/dimos/x`,
`dimos_lcm` and `github.com/dimensionalOS/dimos` hit; `dimosaurus` does not. The run's own
workspace and config paths are stripped first, so a case directory under `~/.local/state/dimos`
is not a hit. A denied call never executes; the model receives
`Tool call denied: its arguments mention the excluded keyword "dimos"...` and continues. The
guard reads arguments only: reasoning or answers that mention dimOS are untouched, and so is
tool output. Denied calls are counted in the trajectory's `extra.blocked_calls`. Pi and dimcode
both enforce it; single-call agents have no tools to guard.

After the run, the runner re-checks executed calls (denied ones are recognised by their result
text) and marks a trial `invalid: ...` in `error` if a keyword got through, for example a
misconfigured extension. Invalid trials count as errors in the summary; report them separately.

### Raw robot topics

`Sim(raw_bridge=True)` adds the `raw-robot-bridge` module to the launch. It republishes the
robot connection's streams as plain Zenoh topics on a per-run loopback port (an attached dimos
uses `tcp/127.0.0.1:7448`), a peer with multicast and gossip scouting off, so a subscriber sees these keys and none of dimOS's own bus:

```
robot/camera/jpeg        JPEG bytes per frame; attachment {"t": unix_seconds}
robot/lidar/xyz_f32      float32 little-endian (N,3) metres in the lidar frame; attachment {"t": ...}
robot/odom/json          {"t","x","y","z","qx","qy","qz","qw"}, base_link in the odom frame
robot/camera_info/json   {"width","height","K"}, republished periodically
robot/cmd_vel/json       subscribed: {"vx","vy","wz","t"}; clamped to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s, held for t seconds (max 2), then stop
```

That is the surface a vendor SDK exposes: sensors out, body velocity with a deadman in. Nothing
above the connection (map, costmap, planner, `move_to`, memory) and nothing beneath it (simulator
state, scene assets). The baseline agent gets a `ROBOT.md` describing the endpoint and builds
whatever it needs from there. The bridge is inert for the dimcode arm, which keeps both
simulator launches identical. On real hardware there is no bridge: the baseline gets the
robot's address and uses the vendor SDK directly, while dimOS records through its own connection.

Budgets: building a recorder, a map and a navigator from live topics is long-horizon work; start
at 250 requests and an hour per case for both arms.

### Shared Pi runtime

Use the same model, reasoning setting, output cap, case selection and timeout
for each harness. Pi and dimcode use Pi's provider SDKs and built-in model
registry; model capabilities and prices are not redefined by dimOS. Pin the
same Pi version in both installations. The integration uses Pi 0.85.1 and
dimcode's local gateway protocol (`0.1.0-next.2` / `0.1.0-next.3`).
`DimcodeAdapter` extends `PiAdapter`, overriding gateway startup, session
configuration and event transport. Provider setup, budgets, tracing and
cleanup remain shared. No second model loop or SDK wrapper is introduced.

To compare another model, change both commands together: `model=gpt-5.6-sol`,
or `provider=anthropic` and `model=claude-fable-5-1`. Fable requires
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, independently of OpenAI access.

`cli=` selects a specific Pi or dimcode executable. `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` optionally override the upstream endpoints. API keys stay
in process environment variables; a shared Pi extension registers the trace
proxy URL and key variable through Pi's provider API. It also applies output
caps and tool selection. No installed registry files are read or rewritten.
Request traces omit authentication headers.

Per-case adapter configuration lives under `dimos.constants.CONFIG_DIR / "evals"`;
temporary gateway sockets use `CACHE_DIR / "evals"`. Home, XDG config/state/cache
and Pi's agent-directory settings are inherited. Both adapters start new sessions
with a copy of the selected recording observations. Pi retains its stock system
prompt with shared case guidance appended. Dimcode retains its production prompt, skills,
MCP integration and rendering tool; shared case guidance accompanies the user
instruction. Each case starts and stops its own dimcode gateway and session.
An existing personal gateway is never attached. Dimcode retains its production
skills; its tools can be restricted with the shared allowlist.

Freeze code/data, record runtime versions, balance execution order, repeat
each case and retain failed trials before interpreting the comparison.

### Tool selection

`allowed_tools` belongs to the shared `AgentConfig`. Use `--allow bash,grep`
on `dimos evals run` or `PiAdapter(allowed_tools=("bash", "grep"))` in Python.
Omit the option to keep the adapter's native defaults; `--allow ""` disables all
tools. Exact tool names are required. Unknown names, duplicates and conflicting
`--allow` / `--set allowed_tools` inputs are errors. The manifest retains the
requested allowlist, and raw requests retain the actual provider schemas.

Pi and dimcode share a Pi extension that selects active tools and blocks excluded
calls. Pi also passes the selection to its CLI. The dimcode adapter verifies that
the extension applied the selection before sending the first prompt. Native MCP
names are those advertised by dimcode, including its endpoint prefix and suffix.
The production MCP-client adapter does not yet implement filtering and rejects
explicit allowlists; single-call agents accept only an empty list or defaults.
Adapters must enforce selection or reject it, never silently ignore it.

Tool selection is independent of what an allowed tool can reach: `--allow bash` still permits any
program on the shell's PATH. Use `no_dimos` to keep dimOS off that path.

### Reading the metrics

- `model_turns`: assistant model responses represented in the trajectory.
  `steps` also includes the initial user instruction.
- `request_attempts`: recorded HTTP requests, including retries. A failed
  attempt can have no assistant response, so this can exceed `model_turns`.
- `tool_calls`: calls requested by those model responses.
- `agent_duration_s`: adapter execution, including recording export, provider
  setup and agent cleanup. `duration_s` additionally includes environment
  startup, settling, teardown and grading.
- Prompt tokens include cache reads and writes; completion tokens include
  reasoning when reported by the provider. `cached_tokens` means cache reads.
- Pi/dimcode `cost_usd` is Pi's registry-based estimate, not a billing receipt.
  Unknown costs remain null (or omitted in ATIF), never a fabricated zero.
  Totals cover recorded assistant responses; interrupted requests may have
  unreported usage. Keep raw attempts when auditing spend.

Errors stay in the summary denominator. An agent error preserves completed
steps, returns `ended_by=error`, and cannot pass. The runner saves a returned
trajectory before environment teardown so teardown failures retain evidence.
Raw requests preserve the actual tools/schemas used on each call; the ATIF
agent metadata includes the latest recorded definition for each tool name.

## Your first eval, end to end

Build a tiny SQLite recording using the same Store/Stream API as the robot's
Recorder (see `dimos/memory/intro.md` for the full Stream API):

```python session=evals ansi=false no-result
import os
from pathlib import Path

os.environ["DIMOS_LOG_LEVEL"] = "WARNING"  # keep doc output stable

from dimos.memory.store.sqlite import SqliteStore
from dimos.msgs.geometry_msgs.PoseStamped import PoseStamped
from dimos.msgs.geometry_msgs.Quaternion import Quaternion
from dimos.msgs.geometry_msgs.Vector3 import make_vector3

Path("/tmp/evals_intro.db").unlink(missing_ok=True)
store = SqliteStore(path="/tmp/evals_intro.db")
odom = store.stream("odom", PoseStamped)
for i in range(20):
    odom.append(
        PoseStamped(position=make_vector3(float(i), 2.5, 0.0),
                    orientation=Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1), frame_id="world"),
        ts=1000.0 + i,
    )
store.stop()
```

A case is one Python literal. `Dataset(..., select=...)` takes a tuple of callables that
receive the opened `Store` and return the `Stream`s the recording holds for
this case: anything the Stream API expresses (windows, filters, single
frames). `grade` reads the agent's final answer:

```python session=evals ansi=false no-result
from dimos.evals.environments.dataset import Dataset
from dimos.evals.scorers import first_number, within
from dimos.evals.types import EvalCase

case = EvalCase(
    id="how_far",
    inputs="How far along x did you travel, in meters?",
    environment=Dataset("/tmp/evals_intro.db", select=(lambda s: s.streams.odom,)),
    # model text -> float, graded: 1.0 exact, linear to 0 at ±1m
    grade=lambda o: within(1.0)(19.0, first_number(o.trajectory.final_answer)),
)
```

Pick an agent and run. `QuestionAnswer` puts `agent_encode()` of every
selected observation (by default, at most 8 per stream, spread evenly) in front of the
question and makes one model call. `chat_model=` injects any LangChain chat
model. Here it is a canned fake so this document runs offline; drop it to use
the agent's `model` with the production construction:

```python session=evals ansi=false
from langchain_core.language_models.fake_chat_models import FakeListChatModel
from dimos.evals.agents.question_answer import QuestionAnswer
from dimos.evals.runner import EvalRunner, summarize

agent = QuestionAnswer(chat_model=FakeListChatModel(responses=["about 19 meters"]))
result = EvalRunner().run([case], agent)[0]
print(f"score={result.score} passed={result.passed} answer={result.final_answer!r} steps={result.steps}")
s = summarize([result])
print(f"n={s.n} mean={s.mean_score} pass_rate={s.pass_rate} errors={s.errors}")
```

```results
score=1.0 passed=True answer='about 19 meters' steps=2
n=1 mean=1.0 pass_rate=1.0 errors=0
```

That's the whole loop: environment -> agent -> trajectory + artifacts ->
grade -> run dir.

To run your cases through the CLI, put them in an importable module with
`SUITE: Suite = [case]`, importing `Suite` from `dimos.evals.types`.

## Agents

Agents live in `dimos/evals/agents/`, one per file. `--agent` takes the
module path; `--set field=value` sets an agent option, e.g.
`--set frames_per_stream=16` for `QuestionAnswer`. In Python, pass the same
options to the constructor: `QuestionAnswer(frames_per_stream=16)`.
CLI values are parsed as JSON when possible; quote lists as shown below.

**Tools.** The case's blueprint decides the tool set:
`DimSimEnvironment(blueprint=...)` or `HabitatEnvironment(blueprint=...)`
supplies the robot stack plus `McpServer`, and its skill containers are the tools.
There is no tool filter. The agent's `modules` list is appended to the
launch command (`dimos run <blueprint> <modules>`), and `autoconnect` dedups
anything shared with the case, so `--set 'modules=["unitree-go2-agentic"]'` adds
the whole shipped agentic stack. On a `Dataset` case the agent's `modules`
are the whole launched stack (`dimos run <modules>`, no simulator or robot
underneath), torn down with the case. Configure those modules to read the
recording if their tools need it. `Dataset(mcp_url=...)` attaches an
already-running dimos instead. To
compare two tool sets on one task, run the suite twice with different
`--set modules=...`; each `trajectory.json` records the tools exposed.

**Limits.** The case's `timeout_s` sets the time budget for the agent and
subsequent motion settling. `McpClientAdapter` returns what it has when its
wait expires, marked `timeout`; `QuestionAnswer` and `Blind` rely on the
model provider's timeout. Environment startup has a separate
`launch_timeout_s`. Pi and dimcode bound model HTTP requests with `max_steps`
(including retries), and optionally cap output per request with `max_output_tokens`.
There is no aggregate token or dollar cap; usage is recorded when the agent supplies it.

**Observation encoding.** Each agent class hard-codes how the recording
reaches the model. `QuestionAnswer` calls `agent_encode()`; no other agent
does. Sending observations a different way means writing a new agent class.

## Scoring

Scores are floats in `[0, 1]`; `passed = score >= threshold`, the case's own
pass bar (`EvalCase.threshold`, default 1.0). Scorers are
plain functions that compose inside `grade`:

```python session=evals ansi=false
from dimos.evals.scorers import choice, exact, first_number, ramp, within, yes_no

print(exact("yes", "yes"), within(2.0)(10.0, 11.0), ramp(1.0, band=2.0))
print(first_number("around 12.5 m"), yes_no("Yes, clearly."), choice(["chairs", "sofas"])("Mostly chairs."))
```

```results
1.0 0.5 0.5
12.5 yes chairs
```

- `exact`: equality. Pair with a parser (`yes_no`, `choice(options)`, `int`) so
  formatting noise doesn't fail a correct answer.
- `within(band)`: graded numeric credit. 1.0 exact, 0.5 halfway, 0 outside.
- `ramp(distance, band)`: same ramp over meters. Msg types support arithmetic,
  so physical graders stay one-liners.
- `judge(rubric)`: LLM-as-judge with partial credit, wrapping the
  langchain/openevals standard.
- `o.trajectory` carries `steps`, `final_metrics`, `extra.ended_by`:
  "under N tokens" or "did not hit `max_steps`" as a pass criterion is the
  grader reading it.

A grader that raises (an unparseable reply, a missing stream) makes that case
an **error**, not a score; the run continues.

## Live environments

`Sim` is the abstract base for simulator environments. Use `DimSimEnvironment`
for DimSim or `HabitatEnvironment` for Habitat.

`DimSimEnvironment` launches `dimos --simulation dimsim --dimsim-scene <scene> --record run
<blueprint> <modules>`, waits for MCP, runs the case's `setup`, and hands out the
recording that `--record` writes (`recordings/<run-id>/memory.db`). The run
ends when the agent finishes or `timeout_s` hits, the environment stops, and
`grade` reads the recording once. `recording(o)` opens it:

```python session=evals ansi=false no-result
from dimos.evals.environments.dimsim import DimSimEnvironment
from dimos.evals.scorers import ramp
from dimos.evals.types import EvalCase, recording
from dimos.msgs.geometry_msgs.Vector3 import Vector3

BED = Vector3(-3.567, -1.332, 0.0)


def ended_near_bed(o):
    store = recording(o)
    try:
        p = store.streams.odom.last().data.position
    finally:
        store.stop()
    return ramp((BED - p).length(), band=2.0)


go_to_bed = EvalCase(
    id="go_to_bed",
    inputs="go to the bed",
    environment=DimSimEnvironment(
        blueprint=["unitree-go2", "mcp-server", "unitree-skill-container"],
        scene="apartment",
    ),
    grade=ended_near_bed,
    timeout_s=180.0,
)
```

```bash
dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.dimsim_house --agent dimos.evals.agents.mcp_client_adapter --set 'modules=["unitree-go2-agentic"]'
```

The recording holds the whole history, so "never left the zone" is `min` over
the `odom` stream in the grader, and "coverage per meter driven" fuses the
recorded `lidar` and integrates `odom`.
`DimSimEnvironment(blueprint=[], attach=True)` drives an
already-running dimos (start it with `--record`) instead of launching one.

For Habitat, select a downloaded dataset and its scene handle on the environment:

```python session=evals ansi=false no-result
from dimos.evals.environments.habitat import HabitatEnvironment

habitat_environment = HabitatEnvironment(
    blueprint=["habitat-nav", "mcp-server", "observe-skill"],
    scene_dataset_config="target/habitat/data/versioned_data/hm3d-0.2/hm3d/example/hm3d_annotated_example_basis.scene_dataset_config.json",
    scene_id="00861-GLAQ4DNUx5U",
    seed=0,
)
```

Pass this environment to an `EvalCase`. Habitat requires a fresh launch and
does not support `attach=True`. It waits for fresh RGB and odometry and records
episode metadata alongside the recording. Its recording topic selection includes
sensor streams and navigation streams supplied by the composed blueprint.
The metadata's `point_cloud_source` describes how Habitat scans are generated
(depth unprojection), not whether scan publication is enabled.

## Running

- **CLI**: `dimos evals run <dotted.suite> --agent <agent-module> [--set model=gpt-4o] [--tags nav] [--limit 5]`
- **Python**: `EvalRunner().run(SUITE, agent, tags=frozenset({"encoding"}))`
- **pytest**: suites are importable lists. Use
  `@pytest.mark.parametrize("case", SUITE)` and assert on `passed`
  (gate live-model tests with `skipif_no_openai`).
- **MCP**: the `EvalModule` skills `run_evals` / `list_eval_suites` /
  `list_eval_agents` return the summary + run dir, so a coding agent can run
  evals, grep trajectories, edit prompts/encodings, and run again.
- **Blind ablation**: run every new suite with
  `--agent dimos.evals.agents.blind` once before trusting it. A case that still
  passes blind is guessable; fix its distractors. `manifest.json` records which
  agent ran, so blind and sighted runs never get mixed up.
- **Preflight**: before anything runs, every case is checked against the
  agent. A missing stream fails with `"No stream 'lidar'. Available: [...]"`,
  a mismatched environment/agent pair with what's missing. Errors are per-case;
  one broken case never kills a run.

Direct `EvalRunner.run(cases, agent)` calls still write a manifest, but mark source and agent
provenance unavailable because arbitrary objects do not identify importable factories. The shipped
CLI and MCP entry points provide that provenance explicitly.
