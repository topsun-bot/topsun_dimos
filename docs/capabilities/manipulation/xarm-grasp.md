# xArm Grasping

`xarm-grasp` is the xArm7 grasping stack: the control coordinator, the wrist
camera, scene registration, pick-and-place and a top-down heuristic grasp
provider. It runs on the real arm by default and switches to the MuJoCo room
scene with `--simulation`:

```bash
dimos run xarm-grasp --xarm7-ip 192.168.1.x     # hardware
dimos run xarm-grasp --simulation mujoco        # the room scene
```

Miss `--xarm7-ip` on hardware and the arm has no address to reach; leave
`--simulation` set and everything reverts to MuJoCo regardless of the IP.
`xarm-grasp-agent` adds an MCP agent over the top; drive it with
`dimos agent-send "..."`.

What differs between the arm and the sim is decided at import time: the hardware
adapter, the base pose, the camera (RealSense plus its mount edge, versus the
MuJoCo wrist camera), the detector backends, and the home pose.

The manipulation viewer is on viser at `http://127.0.0.1:8095`. To watch the
MuJoCo scene itself, add `--headless false` with `MUJOCO_GL=glfw`. On a host
where `/dev/dri` must be hidden from Mesa, run inside the team's existing
`/dev/dri`-masked mount namespace:

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=llvmpipe \
  dimos --viewer none run xarm-grasp --simulation mujoco
```

## The scene

The scene is an enclosed 2.6 m by 3.0 m room. The xArm is bolted to the world
origin. Unlike `data/xarm7`, this scene has no 12 cm pedestal, so the planning
model overrides `base_pose` to match. The 38 cm by 60 cm desk is in front of the
arm, with its work surface at `z=0.13 m`. Six scaled household targets sit on it:

| Object | Body position `(x, y, z)` m | Maximum grasp width | Approximate size |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Dark blue bottle | `(0.58, 0.19, 0.13)` | 6.0 cm | 6.0 × 6.0 × 17.6 cm |
| Gray can | `(0.545, -0.02, 0.13)` | 6.6 cm | 6.6 × 6.6 × 12.2 cm |
| Red cup | `(0.56, -0.22, 0.13)` | 6.8 cm | 6.8 × 6.8 × 6.1 cm |
| Green tape roll | `(0.38, 0.24, 0.13)` | 6.2 cm | 6.2 × 6.2 × 2.3 cm |
| Blue marker | `(0.35, 0.03, 0.13)` | 3.2 cm | 14.0 × 3.2 × 3.2 cm |
| Brown box | `(0.40, -0.19, 0.13)` | 6.0 cm | 8.4 × 6.0 × 4.5 cm |

The canonical positions and geometry live in `data/xarm_grasp_sim/scene.xml`.
The visual meshes were cooked from the `dimos_office` scene package and scaled
for the xArm gripper; primitive geometry is used only for contact. Every target
has a grasp axis below 7 cm, and the gray can is the designated pick smoke
target. The blueprint starts the arm at an elevated, collision-free top-down
scan pose so all six visual meshes fit in the wrist-camera frame.

OWL-ViT labels these synthetic renders unreliably. A scan routinely returns the
right six positions under swapped names, so match objects by position, not label.

## Driving it

In a second terminal, connect to the running blueprint:

```bash
dimos shell
```

Then run this complete scan and obstacle-inspection sequence:

```python skip
from dimos.robot.manipulators.xarm.blueprints.grasp import XARM_GRASP_PROMPTS

app.ManipulationSkills.go_init()
scan = app.PickAndPlaceModule.scan_objects(XARM_GRASP_PROMPTS)
print(scan)

print(app.ObjectSceneRegistrationModule.get_detected_objects())
print(app.ManipulationModule.refresh_obstacles())
print(app.ManipulationModule.get_obstacles())
```

CPU OWL-ViT inference takes about 11 seconds per prompt/frame on the validation
host, so let a scan finish rather than issuing another concurrently.

To pick, hand `pick_object` an `object_id` from that scan. Choose the target by
where its point cloud actually is rather than by name:

```python skip
scene = app.ObjectSceneRegistrationModule

for obj in scan.metadata["objects"]:
    cloud = scene.get_object_pointcloud_by_object_id(obj["object_id"])
    print(obj, cloud.points_f32().mean(axis=0) if cloud else None)

# the bottle sits at roughly (0.58, 0.19); pick whichever id landed there
pick = app.PickAndPlaceModule.pick_object("<object_id>")
print(pick)

app.PickAndPlaceModule.place_at(0.45, -0.25, 0.25)
```

`pick_object` generates the grasps itself, so there is no separate grasp call.
It opens the gripper, plans to the pregrasp, moves in, closes, verifies, and
retreats. The prompt set includes a `green ring` fallback because the tape loses
its category silhouette in the wrist camera's top-down view.

A failed grasp knocks free-body targets out of place, and `MujocoSimModule.reset()`
does not respawn them. Restart the blueprint between pick attempts that need a
pristine scene.
