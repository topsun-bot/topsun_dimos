title: "Remote Teleop"
description: "Drive robots from anywhere in the world, with low latency, from a browser, phone, or VR headset."
---

**dimTELE** is hosted teleoperation for DimOS robots: operate them remotely
from any browser or Quest headset over WebRTC.
The robot dials out to a hosted broker
([teleop.dimensionalos.com](https://teleop.dimensionalos.com)), so you don't
need to open any inbound ports on the
robot's network. It works behind a home router, on Wi-Fi, wired LAN, or
cellular.

## How it works

There are three pieces: the **robot**, the **broker**, and the **operator's
browser**. You never connect to the robot directly.

1. **The robot dials out.** When you run a `teleop-hosted-go2-*` blueprint, the
   robot opens an outbound WebRTC session to the broker and registers itself.
   Because the robot initiates the connection, no inbound ports or port
   forwarding are needed — it works from behind any NAT.
2. **The broker bridges the session.** It sits between the robot and the
   operator, relaying video, the minimap, telemetry, and your commands. It also
   handles login and decides which operators may connect to which robots.
3. **You connect from the browser.** Open the console, pick your robot, and
   click **Connect**. The browser pulls the robot's video track and opens the
   command/telemetry data channels back to it.

Once connected, four streams flow continuously:

| Stream | Direction | Carries |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Video | robot → operator | The selected camera, composited into one live track |
| Minimap | robot → operator | Occupancy grid + robot pose for click-to-navigate |
| Telemetry | robot → operator | Battery, posture, link latency/rate for the HUD |
| Commands | operator → robot | Drive input, sport commands, nav goals, E-STOP |

All broker-facing modules share a single broker session, so there's exactly
one video track and one control plane per robot — see
[How it connects](#how-it-connects) for the channel-level detail.

How low is the latency in practice? With the World Cup on, four Dimensional teammates across the globe; San Francisco, Bangalore, Buenos Aires, and Shanghai played soccer with Go2s hosted in SF, over the public internet.

Below are the latencies recorded:

![Round-trip command latency to robots hosted in San Francisco: ~15 ms from San Francisco, ~114 ms from Bangalore, ~134 ms from Buenos Aires, ~160 ms from Shanghai — every route under the ~200 ms delay of a typical video call](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimensionalOS/dimos-docs-assets/main/capabilities/teleoperation/assets/latency_four_continents.png)

## Quick Start

```bash
TRANSPORTS__BROKER__API_KEY=dtk_live_... \
dimos run teleop-hosted-go2-transport
```

The robot registers with the broker. Open
[teleop.dimensionalos.com](https://teleop.dimensionalos.com), log in, and your
robot appears under **Available Robots**. Click **Connect** and you're driving.

The API key alone is enough — the broker derives the robot identity from it.
`TRANSPORTS__BROKER__ROBOT_ID` / `TRANSPORTS__BROKER__ROBOT_NAME` are optional
overrides. All broker settings can also be passed on the CLI, e.g.
`-o transports.broker.api_key=dtk_live_...`.

## Get an API key

1. Visit [teleop.dimensionalos.com](https://teleop.dimensionalos.com) and sign up.
2. On the dashboard, **API Keys → + New Key**.
3. Copy the key (shown once) and pass it as `TRANSPORTS__BROKER__API_KEY`.

## Available blueprints

| Blueprint | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| `teleop-hosted-go2-transport` | Drive + camera + minimap + click-to-nav (recommended) |
| `teleop-hosted-go2-multicam` | Adds a second RealSense, operator-selectable, mux'd into one video track |

The transport blueprints bind `Cloudflare*` transports directly to the streams
of several small, per-concern modules: `Go2CommandModule` (command / E-STOP /
drive guard), `CameraMuxModule` (camera → video track), `MapCompressModule`
(costmap → minimap), and `HostedStatsModule` (telemetry + acks). The
broker-bound modules run in one worker so they share a single broker session;
the `GO2Connection` driver runs in a second worker (`n_workers=2`).

Enable the glass-to-glass latency benchmark with
`-o cameramuxmodule.latency_stamp=true`.

## Operating the robot

Once the robot is running and you've clicked **Connect**, here's how to operate it.

### 1. Connect

Open [teleop.dimensionalos.com](https://teleop.dimensionalos.com), find your
robot under **Available Robots**, and click **Connect**. Video appears once the
WebRTC session negotiates; the metrics HUD starts populating once telemetry
arrives. If the robot doesn't show up, confirm the blueprint is still running
and that the API key matches the one the robot registered with.

### 2. Drive

Use **WASD** on a desktop keyboard (or the thumbsticks in VR) to
drive: `W`/`S` forward/back, `A`/`D` strafe, and turn with the yaw controls.
Hold **Shift** for 2× speed, **Ctrl** for half speed. Drive input streams
continuously and stops the instant you release — the robot treats a released
key as "stop," so it never keeps coasting on a dropped packet.

### 3. Navigate with the minimap

The minimap shows the robot's costmap and live pose. **Click any point** on it
to send a navigation goal — the robot plans a path and drives there on its own,
avoiding obstacles. Give a manual drive command at any time and it takes over
immediately, cancelling the plan. There's also a **cancel** control to stop
navigating without driving manually.

### 4. Postures and commands

The command bar exposes the robot's allow-listed actions:

- **Stand / sit / recover** — `RecoveryStand`, `StandDown`, `Sit`, and `Damp`
  (relax the joints).
- **Greetings / stretch** — `Hello`, `Stretch`.
- **Acrobatics** — `FrontJump`, `FrontPounce` — only available when the robot
  was launched with `-o go2commandmodule.allow_acrobatics=true`.
- **Obstacle avoidance** — toggle the onboard avoidance layer on or off.
- **Rage mode** — toggle the high-agility gait on or off.
- **Head LED** — set the head light brightness.
- **Camera** — on multicam robots, pick which camera (or side-by-side view) the
  video track shows.

Each command is acknowledged, so the UI reflects what the robot actually did,
not just what you clicked.

### 5. E-STOP

The **E-STOP** control is always available. It immediately stops all motion,
cancels any active navigation, and damps the robot — and it takes priority over
everything else in flight. Clear it with **estop_clear** (or the equivalent
control) when you're ready to resume; the robot won't move again until you do.

## Operator inputs

The browser is modality-agnostic — it streams whatever the device gives it, and
the robot blueprint decides what to do with it.

| Device | Input | Maps to |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Desktop browser | **WASD** keyboard | `TwistStamped` → `cmd_vel` |
| Quest 3 / VR headset | **Left thumbstick** Y → fwd/back, X → strafe; **right thumbstick** X → yaw; grip = boost/slow | same `TwistStamped` path as keyboard |

Shift = 2× speed, Ctrl = ½×. The operator can also send allow-listed sport
commands (StandDown, RecoveryStand, Sit, Damp, Hello, Stretch, and — gated
behind `allow_acrobatics` — FrontJump, FrontPounce),
toggle obstacle avoidance / rage mode / the head LED, pick the camera, E-STOP,
and click the minimap to navigate.

## Live metrics HUD

While connected, the operator sees a metrics overlay, color-coded on video and
command-plane health:

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `fps`, `bitrate`, `loss`, `jitter buffer`, `decode time`, `freezes` | Operator's `getStats()` on the inbound video track |
| `e2e latency` (glass-to-glass) | Frame-embedded capture-time stamp, decoded operator-side (needs `latency_stamp=true`) |
| `RTT` | NTP-style min-RTT clock sync over the reliable datachannel |
| `cmd latency`, `jitter`, `rate` | Robot-measured over the inbound command wire, sent back on `state_reliable_back` |

Pair with the recorder to log a session and emit a stats report:

```bash
dimos run teleop-hosted-go2-transport teleop-recorder
```

This writes `recording_teleop_<ts>.db` + a `report_<ts>.json` on disconnect;
regenerate from an old .db with `python -m dimos.teleop.utils.report path.db`.

## Configuration

Each concern is its own module, so its commonly-tuned fields live under that
module's config key (module class name, lowercased). Pass with `-o`, e.g.
`-o hostedstatsmodule.telemetry_hz=5`.

`hostedstatsmodule` — `HostedStatsModule`:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `telemetry_hz` | `3.0` | Robot → operator HUD push rate |

`go2commandmodule` — `Go2CommandModule`:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `cmd_stale_after_sec` | `0.5` | Drop `cmd_vel` older than this |
| `max_linear_mps` / `max_angular_rps` | `1.5` / `2.0` | Robot-side clamp on operator drive |
| `max_nav_goal_m` | `100.0` | Reject click-to-nav goals farther than this |
| `allow_acrobatics` | `false` | Gate FrontJump / FrontPounce etc. |
| `damp_on_operator_lost` | `false` | Damp the robot when the operator link drops |

`cameramuxmodule` — `CameraMuxModule`:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `latency_stamp` | `false` | Paint the glass-to-glass timestamp strip |
| `video_max_width` / `video_max_fps` | `0` (source) | Publish-side caps for constrained uplinks |
| `cameras` | `["cam1","cam2"]` | Named inputs; first is the boot default view |

`mapcompressmodule` — `MapCompressModule`:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `map_hz` / `odom_hz` | `2.0` / `15.0` | Minimap grid + robot-pose push rates (`0` = off) |
| `map_min_resolution` | `0.1` | Coarsen finer occupancy grids to this m/cell before encoding for the minimap |

Broker settings live under `transports.broker.*`: `api_key` (required),
`broker_url`, `robot_id`, `robot_name` (`"robot"` default), `stun_url`, and
`video_codec` (e.g. `h264`/`vp8`).

## How it connects

The per-process `BrokerProvider` owns the session; blueprint transports bind
to it. Channels:

```text
robot                          broker (Cloudflare)                operator browser/Quest
─────                          ───────────────────                ──────────────────────
  POST /api/v1/sessions  ───►  session + datachannels     ◄───    operator joins
  cmd_unreliable        ◄────  (operator → robot, lossy)  ◄────    WASD / Joy
  state_reliable        ◄────  (operator → robot, json)   ◄────    ping, video_stats, estop
  state_reliable_back   ────►  (robot → operator, json)    ────►   pong, robot_telemetry, cmd_ack
  map_unreliable        ────►  (robot → operator, lossy)   ────►   minimap grid + odom
  video track           ────►  broker publishes + pulls    ────►   <video> sink
```
