# ⚠️ What Works and What Does Not

Let me be up front about performance. As of 2026, for robots moving at human speeds indoors, effectively all camera-based systems are worse than a good 360 lidar. We can still build a production-quality navigation with cameras alone, but only if we do it carefully.

A regular mono raspberry pi camera facing forward on a humanoid, with no data from the motors, is basically impossible to get to get a real time production-grade map out of. However a wheeled robot with motor encoders and a downward-facing RealSense depth camera can do some pretty cool stuff.

Use these rules of thumb:

- We need to create good odometry first.
- To make a good map, we need a depth camera and good odometry.
- Calibration is the difference between incredible and useless. Some cameras, including RealSense cameras, arrive with intrinsics pre-calibrated. Look online for how to calibrate the intrinsics for you camera.
- Make sure everything on your robot is stiff. Flexing and wobble between sensors can ruin performance.
- Stereo cameras are significantly better than mono cameras because they observe metric depth.
- An IR flood light is great, but an IR dot emitter is not. Both are often built into IR cameras. Turn off the IR dot emitter to get better odometry at the cost of some depth quality.
- Global-shutter cameras, such as the RealSense D455, are much better than rolling-shutter cameras, such as the ZED Mini.
- Motor encoder data is a game changer. It significantly improves the final odometry.
- An IMU + camera does not do much, but an IMU + motor encoders improves accuracy significantly.
- Multiple cameras are a game changer. They significantly improve coverage and robustness.

# 🔌 Software Setup

So you've got your robot with a calibrated camera. What next?

1. Either use a dimos camera module, or write your own. Use the dimos Realsense module as an example of how to publish the camera frames, local transform frames, and camera intrinsics.
2. If you have an IMU or the camera has an IMU, make sure those are published as well, again use the Realsense as an example for the IMU message types.
3. You'll need to `tf.publish` a transform between your `base_link` (main point on your robot) and the camera (often called `camera_link`). To do that create a URDF for your robot, then create a `YourRobotStaticTf` module that inherits from `dimos.protocol.tf.static_tf_publisher.StaticTfPublisher`. Use the `SpotHighLevel` module as an example for how to load and publish everything from a URDF.
4. Create a blueprint with the DimSlam module similar to the one below:

```python skip
from dimos.core.coordination.blueprints import autoconnect
from dimos.core.global_config import global_config
from dimos.hardware.sensors.camera.realsense.camera import RealSenseCamera
from dimos.mapping.dim_slam.dim_slam import DimSlam
from dimos.mapping.odometry_hist import OdometryHist
from dimos.visualization.vis_module import vis_module
from dimos.mapping.dim_slam.demo_dim_slam_realsense import rerun_config

blueprint = autoconnect(
    RealSenseCamera.blueprint(
        fps=30,
        enable_infrared=True,
        emitter_enabled=False,
        enable_color=False,
        enable_depth=False,
    ),
    YourRobotStaticTf.blueprint(),
    DimSlam.blueprint(
        camera_mode="stereo", # pick one of "mono", "stereo", "rgbd", or "multisensor".
        imus=[
            # NOTE: keep the robot still for a moment when powering it on to calibrate IMU gravity
            ImuConfig(
                frame_id="camera_accel_optical_frame", # needs to match the frame name from RealSenseCamera (or your camera module)
                gyro_noise_density=2e-4,
                gyro_random_walk=1e-5,
                accel_noise_density=1.8e-3,
                accel_random_walk=1e-4,
            )
        ],
    ),
    OdometryHist.blueprint(),
    vis_module(
        global_config.viewer,
        rerun_config=rerun_config,
    ),
)
```

## Adding wheel odometry

This configuration comes from Alfred, a wheeled robot with a D455 and wheel encoders:

```python skip
DimSlam.blueprint(
    camera_mode="stereo",
    # Alfred's computer has no GPU, so libcuvslam is built
    # with -DENFORCE_GPU=OFF.
    use_gpu=False,
    # Declare stereo order explicitly. Sorting frame names happens
    # to produce left-then-right here, but that is not a contract.
    cameras=[
        CameraConfig(frame_id="d455_infra1_optical_frame"),
        CameraConfig(frame_id="d455_infra2_optical_frame"),
        CameraConfig(
            # Depth is aligned to color and arrives in this frame.
            frame_id="d455_color_optical_frame",
            depth_cloud_max_range=4.0,
            # A full D455 cloud is about 400k points per frame at
            # 30 Hz. Decimation keeps it from drowning the mapper.
            depth_cloud_decimation=5,
        ),
    ],
    imus=[
        ImuConfig(
            frame_id="d455_accel_optical_frame",
            gyro_noise_density=0.0018,
            gyro_random_walk=2e-5,
            accel_noise_density=0.02,
            accel_random_walk=3e-3,
        )
    ],
    # Use fixed variances. Message covariances report accumulated
    # drift rather than the measured delta. Drop visual z.
    visual_odom_pose_variances=Covariance(
        x=0.01,
        y=0.01,
        roll=0.05,
        pitch=0.05,
        yaw=0.05,
    ),
    # Only the wheels measure velocity. dimSLAM's visual estimate
    # does not include twist. Keep wheel z, roll, and pitch as
    # absolute anchors.
    odom_sources=[
        SourceConfig(
            parent_frame_id="wheel_odom",
            child_frame_id="base_link",
            pose_variances=Covariance(
                x=0.05,
                y=0.05,
                z=0.001,
                roll=0.001,
                pitch=0.001,
            ),
            twist_variances=Covariance(
                x=0.02,
                y=0.02,
                yaw=0.05,
            ),
        ),
    ],
    # CPU visual covariance exceeds this during normal driving,
    # so disable the covariance gate.
    covariance_gate_translation_std=0.0,
    # Alfred is holonomic in the plane.
    per_dimension_error_variance=Covariance(
        z=0.01,
        roll=0.01,
        pitch=0.01,
    ),
    # Wheel odometry can cross Wi-Fi seconds late.
    replay_buffer_seconds=2.0,
).remappings(
    [(DimSlam, "odom_sources", "source_odometry")]
)
```

The measured results explain why these details matter:

- Gyro yaw halved final drift on one drive. Wheel-only estimation ended 2.66 m out. Wheel plus gyro ended 1.33 m out. The lidar reference itself set a 0.59 m floor because of its heading error.
- Skipping stationary gyro-bias initialization changed a 1.6 m final error into 19.8 m over a 517-second drive.
- A 4 m depth range produced better mapping quality than 6 m, with top-down F1 scores of 0.570 and 0.506 against a lidar-raycast reference.
- One uncalibrated IMU mount misaligned gravity by about 2.4 m/s² and caused the estimate to diverge.

# 🎚️ Tuning Which Sensors to Trust

Sensors are not equally reliable, and they do not measure the same things. Configure which dimensions of each sensor dimSLAM should trust.

For each variance:

- `0` ignores that dimension.
- A small positive number trusts it more.
- A large positive number trusts it less.
- A negative number uses the covariance carried by the message.

These values are per-axis variances:

- `x`, `y`, and `z` describe translation.
- `roll`, `pitch`, and `yaw` describe rotation.
- Pose translation uses metres and pose rotation uses radians.
- Twist uses m/s and rad/s about the same axes.

## Constrain a ground robot

Start by telling dimSLAM that the robot stays on the ground. An indoor ground robot normally does not move vertically, roll, or pitch.

```python skip
per_dimension_error_variance=Covariance(
    z=1e-6,
    roll=1e-6,
    pitch=1e-6,
)
```

This acts as a virtual zero-twist measurement whenever dimSLAM receives a source message. It prevents sensor error from making the robot sink, rise, or tilt. Use weaker constraints when the robot drives on ramps.

## Visual odometry

A camera can be reliable in some dimensions and unreliable in others:

```python skip
visual_odom_pose_variances=Covariance(
    x=0.01,
    y=0.01,
    z=0.0,
    roll=0.05,
    pitch=0.05,
    yaw=0.05,
)
```

This configuration tells dimSLAM to trust planar translation, ignore visual z, and give the visual part of the rotation estimate less weight. Increase the variances when motion blur or fast rotation makes the visual estimate unreliable. The camera must remain trusted in at least one dimension.

## External odometry

Configure each external source using the exact frames carried by its messages:

```python skip
SourceConfig(
    parent_frame_id="wheel_odom",
    child_frame_id="base_link",
    pose_variances=Covariance(
        x=0.05,
        y=0.05,
        z=0.001,
        roll=0.001,
        pitch=0.001,
    ),
    twist_variances=Covariance(
        x=0.01,
        yaw=0.02,
    ),
)
```

Wheel encoders are good at forward velocity and turn rate. They are weaker as a source of long-term position because small errors accumulate. Trust them less when wheels slip. Skid-steer robots often need a larger yaw variance during turns.

A negative source variance uses the message covariance. A fixed positive variance is usually better for a drifting source because its reported covariance describes accumulated drift, not the measured delta.

A source whose parent is `odom_frame_id` contributes absolute measurements. A source with another parent contributes dimSLAM-anchored deltas because its own pose has drifted.

## IMUs

IMU trust comes from the four noise characteristics in `ImuConfig`, normally taken from the datasheet. Larger noise values give the IMU less influence.

Increase accelerometer noise when robot vibration would otherwise look like real movement. Do not compensate for a bad mount by tuning noise. Fix its transform.

## Four tuning rules

1. Do not use a sensor for dimensions it does not measure. Set those dimensions to zero.
2. Tell the system about physically impossible movement. Constrain z, roll, and pitch on a flat-ground robot.
3. Treat accumulated error carefully. Wheel odometry measures motion well but becomes less reliable as errors accumulate.
4. Tune relative trust. When sensors disagree, the more trusted sensor wins. Focus on the ratio between trust values instead of searching for one perfect number.

# 🛠️ Conclusion and Troubleshooting

Before driving, verify:

- The camera mode matches the connected streams.
- Camera intrinsics are published on `camera_info`.
- Every camera and IMU frame has a correct, rigid tf transform.
- Stereo cameras are declared explicitly, left first.
- Sensor timestamps use compatible clocks and meet the configured skew limit.
- The robot remains still for IMU initialization.
- External odometry frame IDs match its `SourceConfig`.
- Sensor variances include only dimensions each sensor measures.
- Ground constraints match the robot's real motion.
- `world/odom_hist` retraces the driven route in Rerun.

| Symptom | Likely cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| Odometry is fine standing still but wrong while moving | Check timestamps. Stereo pairs must meet cuVSLAM's 1 ms contract. Hardware-triggered D455 pairs do this naturally. Software-triggered rigs may not. Spot images arrive about 15 ms apart and depth can trail by up to 90 ms, causing every frame set to be silently dropped. Set `max_skew_ms=20.0`, or use the measured spread of your rig. |
| Tracking works but the robot moves in the wrong direction | The extrinsics are wrong. A few millimetres of error causes small constant drift. A wrong optical-frame rotation produces complete nonsense. Check tf and the URDF first. |
| Position drifts badly from startup when using an IMU | The robot moved during gyro-bias initialization. Leave it still for about one second. Initialization restarts automatically after it becomes still. |
| Bias initialization never completes | `init_gyro_limit` is below the gyro's noise floor at rest. Raise it above the gyro bias while keeping it below any real rotation. |
| The map has two floors, or the robot appears rolled | z, roll, or pitch are random-walking. Configure `per_dimension_error_variance`. If wheel poses report z, roll, and pitch as zero, keep those dimensions as absolute anchors. |
| The path jumps sharply or resets | The covariance gate is firing. A CPU-only visual estimate's translation standard deviation can start above 1.0 and grow past 9 during normal driving, leaving no useful threshold. Set `covariance_gate_translation_std=0.0` for that case. |
| Gravity is misaligned and the estimate diverges | The IMU mount is uncalibrated. One bad mount produced about 2.4 m/s² of gravity misalignment. Correct the tf transform. |
| Wheel odometry appears to be ignored | Its `parent_frame_id` or `child_frame_id` does not exactly match `header.frame_id` or `child_frame_id` in the messages. Unmatched sources are dropped. |
| Wheel odometry arrives late over Wi-Fi and the estimate stutters | Increase `replay_buffer_seconds`. Alfred uses 2.0 seconds. Late messages make dimSLAM revisit the earlier state and replay subsequent measurements. |
| The depth map looks plausible but has the wrong scale | Check `depth_units_per_meter`. A 16-bit millimetre depth stream uses `1000.0`. |
| The mapper falls behind or drops clouds | A full-resolution depth stream can contain about 400,000 points per frame at 30 Hz. Set `depth_cloud_decimation` and `depth_cloud_max_range`. |
| The rig is mirrored or the stereo baseline sign is wrong | The `cameras` list was empty, so cuVSLAM sorted frame names. Declare the list explicitly with the left camera first. |
| The module warns about the GPU backend | `use_gpu=True` is configured on a machine without a GPU. The CPU path requires `libcuvslam` built with `-DENFORCE_GPU=OFF`. |
