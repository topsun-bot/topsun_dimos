# Creating a Map

Main steps:
1. `dimos run unitree-go2-memory` to create a .db file
2. Auto-clean the .db file into a usable map
3. Load the map back (replay)
4. Load the map into the Go2 (live)

![relocalize on the live go2 and nav_to a point in the premap](assets/reloc_and_nav_to.webp)


## 1. Record a run

```bash
dimos --robot-ip {YOUR_ROBOT_IP} run unitree-go2-memory
```


If `DIMOS_ROBOT_IP` is set in your environment (or `.env`), you can drop
the `--robot-ip` flag:

```bash
dimos run unitree-go2-memory
```

This writes `recording_go2.db` to the repo root. Run the next command
from the repo root so the bare-name lookup finds this file. In the next
steps `{DB_NAME}` refers to the stem of your recording - `recording_go2`
if you kept the default.

## 2. Auto-clean the .db, convert into a Map

To create the map file (`.pc2.lcm`):

```bash
# default name from step 1:
dimos map global recording_go2 --export

# renamed:
dimos map global {DB_NAME} --export
```

`--export` implies `--pgo` (runs pose graph optimization) and writes
`./{DB_NAME}.pc2.lcm` to the current working directory. Add `--no-gui`
to skip the rerun viewer for headless runs.

`{DB_NAME}` can be a file name (with or without extension), or a relative / absolute path.

When a bare file name is given, the tool searches in:

1. current working directory
2. `data/` (where LFS files live)

Examples:

```bash
dimos map global go2_hongkong_office --export
dimos map global ./go2_hongkong_office.db --export
dimos map global data/go2_hongkong_office.db --export
dimos map global /abs/path/to/scan.db --export
```

Sample log:

```

```

## 3. Relocalize against replay

Replay a recording and have the relocalization module localize against
the premap. Use the `unitree-go2-relocalization` blueprint — it's the
standard `unitree-go2` stack plus `RelocalizationModule`:

```bash
dimos --replay --replay-db {DB_NAME} run unitree-go2-relocalization \
  -o relocalizationmodule.map_file={DB_NAME}
```

`{DB_NAME}` is resolved the same way as in section 2: cwd
first, then `data/`.

Sample log:

```
12:58:51.469[inf][imos/mapping/relocalization.py] Relocalization module started: map_file='recording_go2'  loaded_map.frame_id='map'  placeholder TF 'world' -> 'map'  z_offset=20.0

```

`relocalize skipped` means the live submap is still warming up (fewer
than `MIN_LOCAL_POINTS` points). `relocalize rejected` means a candidate
was found but its fitness was below the configured threshold (default
`0.6`). If you want to see every candidate accepted regardless of
quality, disable the gate:

```bash
-o relocalizationmodule.fitness_threshold=0.0
```

You can watch the alignment in Rerun. The merged map is published on
its own entity — to compare the merged costmap (live scan + premap)
against the live scan alone, click the eye icon next to the merged map
entity to toggle it off.

With the merged map hidden you see the partial pointcloud from the
scanning replay plus the full costmap from the merged current scan +
premap.

You can also replay a different recording taken in the same physical
space against the same premap.


## 4. Relocalize on a live robot

Same flags as the replay test, but point at the live robot instead of a
recorded `.db`:

```bash
dimos --robot-ip {YOUR_ROBOT_IP} run unitree-go2-relocalization \
  -o relocalizationmodule.map_file={DB_NAME}
```
