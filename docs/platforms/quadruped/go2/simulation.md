# Unitree Go2 — Simulation

Run the full Go2 navigation stack without any hardware — replay recorded sessions or simulate in MuJoCo. Same code, no robot.

See [Setup](/docs/platforms/quadruped/go2/setup.md) for installing DimOS first.

## Try It — No Hardware Needed

```bash
# Replay a recorded Go2 navigation session
# First run downloads ~2.4 GB of LiDAR/video data from LFS
dimos --replay run unitree-go2
```

Opens the command center at [localhost:7779](http://localhost:7779) with Rerun 3D visualization — watch the Go2 map and navigate an office in real time.

## MuJoCo Simulation

```bash
uv pip install 'dimos[base,unitree,sim]'
dimos --simulation run unitree-go2
```

Full navigation stack in MuJoCo — same code, simulated robot.
