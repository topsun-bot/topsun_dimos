# Unitree G1

![output](assets/g1_rerun.webp)

## Requirements

- Unitree G1 EDU (need SDK/SSH access)
- Laptop/Desktop with Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 with CUDA GPU (recommended), or macOS (experimental)

## 1. Get SSH Access

### Get Ethernet Working
1. Plug an Ethernet cable from the robot into your Laptop
2. Open up your Laptop's graphical network manager, manually set the IP addr of your system to `192.168.123.100`
3. Run wired ssh command:

```bash
ssh -L 3030:localhost:3030 unitree@192.168.123.164
# Password: 123
```

### Use Ethernet to get WiFi Working

After ssh-ing in, find additional IPs:
```bash
hostname -I
```
The second address allows SSH after disconnecting Ethernet.

WiFi passwords (varies by unit): `888888888` or `00000000`

### Network Interface Names

Common interface names needed for SDK examples:
- `eth0` / `enp2s0`: Ethernet
- `wlan0`: WiFi

Check with: `ip addr show`

### Remote Network

Recommended to setup [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/tailscale-ssh) to avoid needing to setup rounter specific configuraions for wireless control.

## 2. Install dimOS

SSH into the robot, then:

```bash
# pick the "developer" setup
bash <(curl -fsSL https://pub-4767fdd15e6a41b6b2ce2558d71ec8d9.r2.dev/install.sh)
```

#### Notes

dimOS handles DDS setup automatically. If you're using the Unitree SDK directly, set:
```bash
export CYCLONEDDS_HOME="$HOME/cyclonedds/install"
```

## 3. Get the G1 in Sport Mode

**WARNING**: You *need* to have the G1 in a good physical position before running this.

Get the hand-held controller for the G1.

Note: this button combination may vary based on the model of the G1

1. If you have a gantry, hang the robot up where its feet are touching the floor, knees straight.
   - Press **L2 + B** (no movement, color change)
   - Press **L2 + Up** (should straighten out)
   - Press **R2 + A** (will attempt to self-balance)
2. If don't have a gantry, there is a make-shift way to get it working. You should get a second person to help.
   - Make the robot lie down flat on the ground
   - Press **L2 + B** (no movement, color change)
   - Press **L2 + Up** (should straighten out)
   - The robot will be super stiff now. Manually pick it up into a standing position and hold it there.
   - Press **R2 + A** (will attempt to self-balance)

## 4. Start G1 teleoperation

The robot must already be standing and balancing in sport mode. Use a clear,
level work area, keep the Unitree remote and emergency stop reachable, and use
a gantry or spotter for the first hardware run. Keep the robot stationary while
using Quest arm teleoperation or planned manipulation; Quest thumbsticks do not
command locomotion in this blueprint.

On the G1 computer:

```bash
uv sync --extra all
uv run dimos run unitree-g1-teleop --network-interface eth0
```

The teleop blueprint excludes navigation and mapping, so no module-disable
arguments are needed. Wait for the Quest server to listen on port `8443`, then
activate the robot from a second SSH session:

```bash
uv run dimos hardware g1 status
uv run dimos hardware g1 activate
uv run dimos hardware g1 status
uv run dimos hardware g1 ready
```

`activate` runs the GR00T pose ramp and requires interactive confirmation before
enabling output. Check the status before `ready` moves both arms to the
conservative ready pose. Routine startup must use these hardware commands rather
than `dimos shell`. `activate --ready` remains available as a combined shortcut.

Open `https://<g1-computer-ip>:8443/teleop` in the Quest browser and accept the
self-signed certificate.

| Input | Operation |
|---|---|
| Hold X + A | Engage both arms from a shared reference pose |
| B | Start or save a recording episode |
| Y | Discard the current episode |

The blueprint also serves the Viser manipulation panel at
`http://<g1-computer-ip>:8095`. It can execute arm motion; only expose this port
on a trusted robot network. Quest arm targets preempt planned arm trajectories.

When finished, cancel arm motion, enter dry-run, and disarm:

```bash
uv run dimos hardware g1 disable
```

## 5. Legacy navigation viewer example

In the ssh terminal `ssh -L 3030:localhost:3030 unitree@192.168.123.164`

```sh skip
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run dimos --rerun-host 0.0.0.0 run unitree-g1-nav-simple
# should print out something like:
# ============================================================
# Rerun gRPC server running (no viewer opened)
#
# Connect a viewer:
#   dimos-viewer --connect rerun+http://0.0.0.0:9877/proxy --ws-url ws://0.0.0.0:3030/ws
#   dimos-viewer --connect rerun+http://192.168.123.164:9877/proxy --ws-url ws://192.168.123.164:3030/ws  # eth0
#   dimos-viewer --connect rerun+http://100.88.236.73:9877/proxy --ws-url ws://100.88.236.73:3030/ws  # tailscale0
#   dimos-viewer --connect rerun+http://10.0.0.197:9877/proxy --ws-url ws://10.0.0.197:3030/ws  # wlan0
#   dimos-viewer --connect rerun+http://172.17.0.1:9877/proxy --ws-url ws://172.17.0.1:3030/ws  # docker0
#
#   hostname: ubuntu
# ============================================================
```

On your laptop:

```sh skip
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv --python "3.12"
# use uv to get the dimos viewer
uvx dimos-viewer --version

# run the connect command. NOTE: the address will be different for you
uvx dimos-viewer --connect rerun+http://100.88.236.73:9877/proxy --ws-url ws://100.88.236.73:3030/ws
```

The viewer should open up. It'll run in faster-than-real speed until its caught up with reality, then should show what's happening in real time.

## Troubleshooting

### `libgomp.so.1: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block`

RoboPlan 0.6.0's aarch64 wheel bundles a renamed private `libgomp`, while
Pinocchio loads the system copy. On affected systems, start the blueprint with
both libraries preloaded:

```bash
ROBOPLAN_GOMP="$(find "$PWD/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/roboplan.libs" \
  -maxdepth 1 -name 'libgomp-*.so*' -print -quit)"
test -n "$ROBOPLAN_GOMP" || {
  echo "RoboPlan's bundled libgomp was not found"
  exit 1
}

LD_PRELOAD="$ROBOPLAN_GOMP:/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1" \
  uv run --no-sync dimos run unitree-g1-teleop --network-interface eth0
```

Preloading only the system library is insufficient. If startup still fails,
confirm that `ROBOPLAN_GOMP` resolves to a file and appears first in
`LD_PRELOAD`.

### Activation or ready-pose recovery

Use the individual stages to identify whether the arming ramp, output enable,
or planned ready motion failed:

```bash
uv run dimos hardware g1 arm
uv run dimos hardware g1 enable
uv run dimos hardware g1 ready
```

`ready` requires completed arming, enabled output, and disengaged Quest arm
tracking. Run `uv run dimos hardware g1 disable` before restarting the sequence.

### A mapping module tries to build with Nix

Update this branch. The G1 teleop blueprint no longer includes Point-LIO, voxel
mapping, cost mapping, route planning, or the navigation web view. Seeing one
of those modules means the checkout predates the upper-body-only composition.

### `dimos hardware g1 status` cannot connect

The teleop blueprint must still be running, and both terminals must use the
same dimOS transport configuration. Check the primary process with
`uv run dimos status` and `uv run dimos log -f`.

### Ready-pose planning fails

Do not bypass the planner. Confirm that the robot is stationary, both arm and
waist joint states are arriving, no object starts in collision with the upper
body, and `status` lists `g1_upper_body/left_arm` and
`g1_upper_body/right_arm`.

#### Keyboard Controls Not Working

This usually means port `3030` wasn't forwarded. The `3030:localhost:3030` in the ssh command is what forwards the port. If you use VS Code with the SSH plugin, ports will be forwarded automatically. However sometimes the auto-forward will map 3030 to 3031 - thus breaking the connect command. Clear whatever is on port 3030 (on the G1 sid and the Laptop) then try again.

#### Viewer Crashing

If the viewer keeps crashing for you, there are two options for now:
1. On the G1 (ssh connection) change `_MAX_HZ` (inside `dimos/robot/unitree/g1/blueprints/primitive/unitree_g1_vis.py`) to a lower number, like 20 or 15
2. Get more RAM
